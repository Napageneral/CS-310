In this assignment, and in this class in general, students shall avoid writing to the standard system output
or screen unless specifically directed. In reality, one cannot guarantee the program under development
will ever use a display, so sending output to them may serve no useful purpose. Thus, students shall only
write to the screen when reporting errors about the syntax of the program call (e.g., incorrect number of
parameters), being unable to read the input file, or the inability to generate an output file.
Any other errors or anomalies shall appear in the output file itself in clearly written terms.
